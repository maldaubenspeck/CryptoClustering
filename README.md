# CryptoClustering

# The Challenge
In this challenge, the objective is to leverage Python and unsupervised learning techniques to determine whether cryptocurrencies are influenced more by short-term (24-hour) or long-term (7-day) price changes. This analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in cryptocurrency price movements over different time frames, which can provide valuable insights for traders and investors.

# The Process
To tackle this challenge, we first collect historical price data for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. We then preprocess the data to ensure consistency and remove any outliers or missing values. Next, we apply unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-means clustering or hierarchical clustering to cluster the cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns over 24-hour and 7-day periods.

Once the clustering is performed, we analyze the clusters to identify whether certain groups of cryptocurrencies exhibit stronger correlations with short-term or long-term price changes. We evaluate the clustering results using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and different time frames.
